I'm Saima Yunus! I'm a computer engineering student and an aspiring programmer. My top two languages are C++ and Python; I've also dabbled in HTML and CSS.

I'm currently learning JavaScript, and I'm currently working on some projects with C++, Python, and Flask.
  - I am looking to create some database management systems with C++
  - I am making a simple "graphs" application in Python using Matplotlib
  - I am also working on a notes app in Flask
  
  I enjoy reading, writing, singing, coding, etc.
