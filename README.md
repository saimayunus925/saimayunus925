### Hi there üëã

I'm Saima Yunus, an aspiring software developer and recent graduate in computer engineering from SJSU. During my time as a Cisco technical intern, I gained valuable experience in the field. My primary programming languages are C++ and Python, and I'm also proficient in HTML/CSS and Flask. Additionally, I have familiarity with React and basic JavaScript.

As an entry-level software developer, I find joy in various activities such as solving programming problems, exploring web development, indulging in Bollywood dancing, expressing myself through singing, engaging in creative writing, honing my cooking and baking skills, going for cycling adventures, and making witty pop culture references. Reading is another passion of mine, and I'm always eager to discover new stories.

Feel free to reach out to me through the following channels:
